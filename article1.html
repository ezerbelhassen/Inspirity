          <p>Tesla motors are known for manufactures of the most advanced electric vehicles and electric powertrains in the world. Tesla motors manufactured the first fully electric sports car, Tesla Roadster in 2008.<a href="http://tesla.com" style="color: #7780d9">Visit Website</a></p>
          <p>The auto industry is huge and touches the lives of almost everyone on the planet. But it's surprisingly devoid of truly gripping stories.In fact, you can almost draw a straight line from Henry Ford to Elon Musk, with perhaps a few detours toward Enzo Ferrari, Preston Tucker, and John DeLorean along the way.What Tesla's original founders and later Musk as CEO of the 13-year-old carmaker have achieved is simply astonishing — unprecedented, really..</p>
          <p>The auto industry has chewed up and spit out plenty of adventurous entrepreneurs over the decades. But Musk and Tesla just thrived — thanks to a massive stock rally this year, the company's market cap has surpassed two of the biggest chewers and spitters: GM and Ford.Tesla hasn't yet become a victim of its own success, but others have. On Monday, Ford ousted its CEO of almost three years, Mark Fields — after two solid years of record profits. Numerous postgame analyses of Fields' departure pointed to Tesla's surge and Ford's lagging behind Silicon Valley's disruptive innovators.That's wrong; Fields left because he had presided over a 40% stock slide. He's a big boy, and he knew that as CEO of a public company — and one still controlled by the Ford family — he had to keep the stock price up. So it goes.</p>
          <p>But the Tesla surge didn't help his cause. In fact, it isn't helping anybody's cause in the traditional industry, which has been riding high with record sales and earnings at a time when Tesla can barely move 80,000 vehicles per year and is burning through cash at an alarming, profitless rate. Old-school carmakers would like to express some self-confidence, but Tesla won't let them.</p></div>
