          <p>Google’s original business was creating algorithms to help people sort quickly through the rapidly growing amount of content being put online. Rather than employ editors and researchers to curate links for specific queries, Google began building algorithms that scored the content it was indexing against specific criteria. These included novel concepts like inbound links from trusted sources as well as standard measures like keyword frequency and page titles. All of these pieces came together in a pagerank that decided where a site would display on a specific query..<a href="http://tesla.com" style="color: #7780d9">Visit Website</a></p>

          <p>Google sees innovation as part of the mission of the company and empowers its employees to get creative. This is how an internet company started building <a href="/terms/w/wearable-technology.asp">wearable tech</a>, mobile operating systems, driverless cars, and renewable energy. Money is no longer Google’s primary concern as it has enough to make the <a class="termLink" data-inlink="link_15" href="/terms/c/capital-investment.asp">capital investment</a> needed to create a beta version seem small in comparison. The <a href="/financial-edge/0113/how-corporate-culture-affects-your-bottom-line.aspx">company culture</a> is focused on innovating first, getting the real user data second and worrying about&nbsp;monetizing afterwards. With Google’s ability to generate revenue through Adwords, the monetizing of a product is fairly straightforward as long as enough people want to use it.
